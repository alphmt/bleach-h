         the attribute translate="true". -->

         the whole element. -->

    <!-- The option label must be specific and should quickly give
           the user the jist of what the action does.  Where possible,
           use the same description as another cleaner to avoid
           unnecessary translations.  Good option labels include

           There are three different types of actions.  In each case,
           you should make the pattern as specific as possible to
           avoid deleting files unintentionally.

           type="file" deletes a single file -->
    <action type="file">/tmp/secret.log</action>
    <!-- type="children" deletes all files under the directory (but
           not the parent).  In this case, the attribute 'directories'
           is required to specify whether to delete directories too
           (or if false, leave the directories empty). -->
    <action type="children" directories="false">/var/tmp/</action>
    <!-- type="glob" deletes all pathnames matching the shell glob
           pattern described in the Python documentation.
           http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-glob.html -->
    <action type="glob">/tmp/*.bak</action>
    <action type="glob">/var/log/*.[0-9].gz</action>
    <action type="glob">/tmp/?.bak</action>
    <!-- type="winreg" without the attribute 'name' deletes 
           Windows registry keys -->
    <action type="winreg">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU</action>
    <!-- type="winreg" with the attribute 'name' deletes a 
           named value under a Windows registry key -->
    <action type="winreg" name="CurrentVersion">HKCU\Software\BleachBit</action>
  </option>
