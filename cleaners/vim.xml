FIXME: Because this uses deep scan, BleachBit assumes it exists, so
it shows up for all users on Windows and Linux. Develop a way to
hide VIM, unless it is really installed.

Here is an example. When editing foo.txt, VIM makes a file called .foo.txt.swp
that starts with a period.

If the .swp file exists, it will cycle through the alphabet according to
this post
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vim_use/JBHSs3kPPJU/X9WeMsZcfWAJ

The likeliness of VIM not being able to create a swap on the first three
times is small.

Be careful not to match files such as ~/.htpasswd
